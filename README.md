<h1>Source Code Stylometry</h1>

<p>IcodeNet is concerned with code stylometry which  is the application of stylometry to computer code to attribute authorship to anonymous binary or source code. Code stylometry involves breaking down and examining the distinctive patterns and characteristics of the programming code and then comparing them to one's whose authorship is already known.</p>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The system is divided into the following steps :-</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Preprocessing</li>
      <li>Feature Extraction</li>
      <li>Classification</li>
     </ul>
  <li>We have used the following three models for implementation :-</li>
  <ul>
      <li>VGG16</li>
      <li>VGG16 + LSTM</li>
      <li>VGG16 + CNN</li>
     </ul>
</ul>
